ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Suhani!

ðŸŽ“ I'm currently a student at Shri Shankaracharya Technical Campus, with a passion for coding, data science, and artificial intelligence. Over time, I've developed skills in Python, C programming, and various machine learning techniques.

ðŸ”§ I enjoy working on hands-on projects that bring concepts to life. From creating voice recognition chatbots to exploring AI-driven solutions, I love pushing boundaries with technology. I'm also interested in the applications of gesture recognition and sign language translation.

ðŸ’¡ My goal is to continuously learn and contribute to innovative projects, whether it's through participating in hackathons or building practical tools that solve real-world problems. I'm excited to share my journey and projects here on GitHub!

ðŸ“« Feel free to connect or collaborate with me on any interesting ideas or challenges! Let's code something amazing together!
